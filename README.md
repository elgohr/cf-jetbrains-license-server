# JetBrains License Server for Cloud Foundry

This repository contains the license server for JetBrains products, configured to be hosted on [Cloud Foundry](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/).

### Deployment
For deployment on Cloud Foundry the following command.

```bash
cf push jetbrains-license-server \
-o lgohr/cf-jetbrains-license-server \
-m 1024M \
-k 512M
```

Hint: This command assumes, that you are logged in to Cloud Foundry and that the [Docker Support](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/adminguide/docker.html) is enabled.

### Registration

Sadly Jetbrains License server doesn't provide an official way to configure the License Server with a license.
Nevertheless this deployment can be configured to do so.
In this way the environment variables `USER`, `PASSWORD` and `SERVER_NAME` have to be configured.  
E.g. via Manifest on Deployment, as there is no other way on `cf push` right now.
```yaml
applications:
- name: jetbrains-license-server
  instances: 1
  memory: 1024M
  disk_quota: 512M
  docker:
    image: lgohr/cf-jetbrains-license-server
  env:
    JETBRAINS_USERNAME: {USERNAME_FOR_JETBRAINS}
    JETBRAINS_PASSWORD: {PASSWORD_FOR_JETBRAINS}
    SERVER_NAME: {SERVER_NAME}
```
You could also push the app and configure the environment variables afterwards via `cf set-env`
In the case that you configured it via `cf set-env`, you have to `cf restage` the application afterwards.

| Variable                   | What's that?                                               |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| JETBRAINS_USERNAME         | Email or Username from https://account.jetbrains.com/login |
| JETBRAINS_PASSWORD         | Password from https://account.jetbrains.com/login          |
| SERVER_NAME                | see bellow                                                 |

When you do the manual registration flow, after logging in, you'll be redirected to https://account.jetbrains.com/server-registration  

This site looks like:

___JetBrains License Server___

_You already have license server set up. Would you like to re-use that or create new one?_

_[O] SERVER_NAME: SERVER_ID_  
_[ ] SERVER_NAME: SERVER_ID_  
_[ ] SERVER_NAME: SERVER_ID_  
_[ ] New Server Registration_  

_[SUBMIT]_

As you can see, the SERVER_NAME must be a unique string.  
Don't try to use the SERVER_ID, because this will change every time you register a new Server!
